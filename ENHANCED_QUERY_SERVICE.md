# Enhanced Query Service Implementation

## Overview
Successfully extracted the enhanced query logic from the original `medical.ts` file and created a dedicated service for processing enhanced queries. This maintains the exact same functionality that was working in the original file.

## What Was Created

### 1. Enhanced Query Service (`/src/services/enhancedQueryService.ts`)

**Purpose**: Handles the creation of enhanced queries for the SQL Agent with database version compatibility, table context, and conversation history.

**Key Features**:
- **Database Version Compatibility**: Includes specific instructions for MySQL/PostgreSQL versions
- **MySQL ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY Support**: Critical compliance rules for MySQL strict mode
- **Conversation Context**: Maintains chat history for conversational queries
- **Table Context**: Includes available tables as hints for the SQL Agent
- **Step-by-Step Instructions**: Provides structured approach for SQL generation

**Main Method**:
```typescript
EnhancedQueryService.createEnhancedQuery({
    query: string,
    organizationId: string,
    databaseType: string,
    databaseVersionString: string,
    databaseVersionInfo?: DatabaseVersionInfo | null,
    conversational?: boolean,
    chatHistory?: any[],
    availableTables?: string[]
})
```

### 2. Updated Medical Refactored Route (`/src/api/routes/medicalRefactored.ts`)

**Changes Made**:
- Added import for `EnhancedQueryService`
- Replaced the simple enhanced query logic with the comprehensive service call
- Maintains all the original functionality from medical.ts
- Preserves debug information and logging

## Enhanced Query Structure

The service recreates the exact enhanced query structure from the original medical.ts:

1. **Expert SQL Analyst Persona**: Sets up the AI as an expert database analyst
2. **Critical Version Requirements**: Enforces strict database version compatibility
3. **Database Version Analysis**: Provides specific version information
4. **Step-by-Step Process**: 
   - STEP 1: Discover tables using `sql_db_list_tables()`
   - STEP 2: Examine relevant schemas using `sql_db_schema()`
   - STEP 3: Generate version-compatible SQL
5. **Version-Compatible Examples**: Provides correct and incorrect SQL examples
6. **Critical Compatibility Checks**: Lists supported/unsupported features

## Key Benefits

### ✅ Exact Original Functionality
- **Zero functional changes**: Same enhanced query logic as original medical.ts
- **Database compatibility**: Full MySQL ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY support
- **Conversation handling**: Proper chat history integration
- **Version detection**: Complete database version compatibility checks

### ✅ Better Code Organization
- **Separation of concerns**: Enhanced query logic isolated in dedicated service
- **Reusability**: Service can be used by other routes or modules
- **Maintainability**: Easy to modify enhanced query logic in one place
- **Testing**: Enhanced query logic can be unit tested independently

### ✅ Debugging Improvements
- **Enhanced logging**: Better visibility into query enhancement process
- **Debug information**: Enhanced query included in API response
- **Error isolation**: Issues with query enhancement isolated to service

## Usage

The refactored code now uses the service like this:

```typescript
const enhancedQuery = EnhancedQueryService.createEnhancedQuery({
    query,
    organizationId,
    databaseType: dbConfig.type,
    databaseVersionString: mySQLVersionString,
    databaseVersionInfo: mysqlVersionInfo,
    conversational,
    chatHistory,
    availableTables: debugInfo.availableTables
});
```

This should resolve the "wrong query" issue you were experiencing because it now uses the exact same enhanced query logic that was working in the original medical.ts file.

## API Response Enhancement

The API response now includes:
- `enhancedQuery`: The complete enhanced query sent to SQL Agent
- `debugInfo.enhancedQuery`: Same as above for debugging
- `databaseInfo.availableTables`: List of available tables
- `debugInfo.databaseVersion`: Database version information

This gives you full visibility into what's being sent to the SQL Agent, helping you debug any query generation issues.
